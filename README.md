# C++ Code Exercises and other Miscellaneous Code

This repository contains the solutions developed for solving various exercises in the "C++ How to Program" textbook by Paul and Harvey Dietel.

The purpose is to document all the code written, and also catalog it for future reuse.

## How to use the repository

1. Make necessary changes to the ``main.cpp`` to create a driver program.

2. Use the ``MakeFile`` to automatically compile all the library code and run the executable

```bash
make all
```

This compiles all the files including the ``main.cpp`` and runs it to show the output.
